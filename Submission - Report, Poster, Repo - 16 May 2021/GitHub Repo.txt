Turnitin requires more than 20 words for submissions, so I found a little piece of
trivia you may not have known:

M&M's stands for Mars and Murrie's.

Forrest Mars (son of the Mars Company founder) first spotted the British confection
Smarties during the Spanish Civil War and noticed the candy shell prevented the chocolate
from melting. He teamed up with Bruce Murrie (son of Hershey Chocolate's president)
and the company later trademarked the "Melts in Your Mouth, Not in Your Hand" slogan.
